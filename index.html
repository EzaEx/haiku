            SPRING - Blossom falls. I stand 
            by and observe its beauty. 
            Happiness follows

            FLOWERS - Flowers line the moor,
            bees sing praise to the colours
            and the beauty shown

            STARS - Night reveals the stars,
            so small twinkling above. 
            Candles in darkness

            WINTER - Cold air settles now,
            covering the ground with small
            beautiful crystals

            SUNRISE - Warmth covers the earth
            calming even the most stressed
            people in small parts

            SKY - Now the clouds part ways, 
            I gaze upon the blue sky,
            causing some comfort

            SNOWFALL - White powdery flakes
            litter the ground, covering
            everything there

            SUNRISE #2 - As the tar black sky 
            disappears into blue light, 
            colours mark its death

            DREAMS - Dreams illuminate
            sleeping minds like small lanterns
            in a dark chamber

            LOVE - Love scorns my hurt mind,
            Falsifying happiness;
            Nature's true illusion

            LOVE #2 - Love. A deceptive
            illusion which manifests
            in everyone

            THOUGHTS - Boredom consumes me,
            causing me to crave the void. 
            Darkness calls to me

            THOUGHTS #2 - My thoughts are dammed, 
            Dark, desolate and yet free.
            It's its own young beast

            ESCAPE - Ever thought of trying
            to disappear completely
            and live life unknown?

            LORRY - Alone cityfied
            An old dreary lorry squeaks
            betrayed by the girls

            PEOPLE - Though I know people
            I don't understand them all.
            I guess I'll eat pie

            SMILES - Smiles solve nothing.
            They are a nebula of
            questions; no answers
