SPRING - Blossom falls. I stand 
by and observe its beauty. 
Happiness follows 

FLOWERS - Flowers line the moor,
Bee's sing praise to the colours
and the beauty shown

STARS - Night reveals the stars,
so small twinkling above. 
Candles in darkness

WINTER - Cold air settles now,
covering the ground with small
beautiful crystals

SUNRISE - Warmth covers the earth
Calming even the most stressed
people in small parts

SKY - Now the clouds part ways, 
I gaze upon the blue sky,
causing some comfort

SNOWFALL - White powdery flakes
litter the ground, covering
everything there

SUNRISE #2 - As the tar black sky 
disappears into blue light, 
colours mark its death

DREAMS - Dreams illuminate
sleeping minds like small lanterns
in a dark chamber

LOVE - Love scorns my hurt mind,
Falsifying happiness;
Natures true illusion

LOVE #2 - Love. A deceptive
illusion which manifests
in everyone

THOUGHTS - Boredom consumes me,
causing me to crave the void. 
Darkness calls to me

THOUGHTS #2 - My thoughts are dammed, 
Dark, desolate and yet free
It's its own young beast

ESCAPE - Ever thought of trying
to disappear completely
and live life unknown? 

LORRY - Alone cityfied
An old dreary lorry squeaks
betrayed by the girls

PEOPLE - Though I know people
I dont understand them all
I guess I'll eat pie

SMILES - Smiles solve nothing.
They are a nebula of
questions; no answers
